# Bank System
The end goal of this banking system is to have an app with a GUI where the user can log in, create accounts, and transfer money.

You MUST have the JavaFX SDK installed for this to compile and run.

To compile:
javac --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls *.java

To run the app:
java --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls Dashboard

This is a complete program that can deposit, withdraw, transfer your money and show all the previous transactions with just a click of the button
